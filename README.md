JavaScript Quiz Game


Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

This Quiz has 5 questions on the topic of JavaScript and I used some basic CSS to create the layout rather than bootstrap. I believe it follows most of the criteria quite well.

-Upon getting a correct answer the answer loads to the 'SCORE' box 
- Upon getting an answer incorrect I was able to make it take away 5 seconds from the timer
-Upon completion I was able to add a High Score list where you can enter your name and score as well as a clear button to remove the scores.
