# Homework-4
- Build a timed code quiz with multiple choice questions
- Start the quiz with a start button which will start the pre determined clock time (I'm thinking 10 seconds per question, may be adjusted)

- Present one multiple choice question at at time
- Give 4 possible answers
- Store answers for later use as a score
- Incorrect answer subtracts time from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the clock hits 0 then the game is over
- When the game is over then show final score and ask for initials and store them
