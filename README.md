# Homework-4
- Build a timed code quiz with multiple choice questions
- Start the quiz with a start button which will start the pre determined clock time (I'm thinking 10 seconds per question, may be adjusted)

- Present one multiple choice question at at time
- Give 4 possible answers
- Store answers for later use as a score
- Incorrect answer subtracts time from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the clock hits 0 then the game is over
- When the game is over then show final score and ask for initials and store them

I worked on this for a few days, running over my allotted time. I was able to get fairly close and I was able to add the local storage functionality although I was walked through it pretty slowly. I Understand the general idea of local storage but the more I use it, the more I will truly understand what the commands mean.

This Quiz has 5 questions on the topic of JavaScript and I used some basic CSS to create the layout rather than bootstrap. I believe it follows most of the criteria quite well.

-Upon getting a correct answer the answer loads to the 'SCORE' box 
 - Upon getting an answer incorrect I was able to make it take away 5 seconds from the timer
 -Upon completion I was able to add a High Score list where you can enter your name and score as well as a clear button to remove the scores.
 
 I hope you enjoy my modest assignment as the output did not match the effort but I had to move forward.
 
 Thank you,
